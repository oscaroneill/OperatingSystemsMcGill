/*
- Each program executed by the shellâ€™s exec command is loaded into ram[]
- Programs need to be in ram[] at the same time
- Each line from the source file is loaded into its own cell in the array
- Enough space for 1000 lines of code, so 333 lines of code, on average, per program
- If there is not enough space to store all the lines in the script then the load terminates
with an error
- A NULL pointer indicates that there is no code at that cell location in ram[]

When a program is loaded to ram[] the following operations happen:
1. fopen the script
2. Find the next available cell in ram[]
3. Copy all the lines of code into ram[]
4. Remember the start cell number and the ending cell number of that script in ram[]

To read a line from the program do:
- fgets(file,buffer,limit);
- ram[k] = strdup(buffer);
where k is the current line of the program

When the program has finished executing do:
- ram[k]=NULL;
for all the lines of code in ram[]
