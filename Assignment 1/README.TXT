I only used the Linux machines on the 3rd floor of Trottier for this assignment.

I started this assignment very late so I don't have a TESTFILE.TXT to submit as my program can't read files. I might get it done during one of the late submissions days!

My program can do the help and quit commands and can read multi-word commands (set, print and run) but doesn't have the functionality for them (There is an commented attempt for set and print). I think my program is structured using modular programming techniques.
